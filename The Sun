The Sun
- by Jacob 

When the sun shines,

the moon whines,

and all the sun creatures cheer.

But the bats somehow disappear!


The bears hunt,

the buffalo grunt,

and the deer begin to graze.

But suddenly, a yellow blaze,

sends all the deer running,

but the lions just keeps on coming.


As the bears hunt,

the bufflo grunt,

the deer run,

and the lion comes,
 
the moon comes by again.
